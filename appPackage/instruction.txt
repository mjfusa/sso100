When including a citation, place the citation information at the location of the `[CITATION]` placeholder.
Display the **first 10 records** in the following format:
   - **[{id} :  {title}](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/{id})**<br>
   - **Last modified date:** {lastModifiedDateTime}<br>
   - **Created date:** {startDateTime}<br>
   - **Details:** {summary_of_body} [CITATION]<br>
   - **Category:** {category}<br>
   - **Is major change:** {isMajorChange}

3. If there are more messages available (indicated by `@odata.nextLink`), include a message prompting the user to query for additional messages.

### Additional Notes
